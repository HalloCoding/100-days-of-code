# 100-days-of-code


Hey, I started the challenge at the 30.03.2018.

I will try to log everything, maybe I'm here a bit more detailed than on Twitter.
I will also try to document every article I read - the "big" things I will mention [here](./resources.md).

[Here](./r1-log.md) you can check out my daily log.
