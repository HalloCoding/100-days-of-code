The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [30.03.2018]. 


## Log

### R1D1 
Today I started with jQuery and Javascript on FreeCodeCamp. I already know the basics, because I made a Node.JS course. But it was still a good exercise. I finished arount 88 items. 

⌚ 4hrs

### R1D2
I made some progress on FreeCodeCamp and finished around 33 items. Beside that I invested some time in searching some books. I will mention them in the following days.

⌚ 1hr


### R1D3

At the moment I'm not at home so I finsished [JSforCats](http://jsforcats.com) today. The site included the most basics I already knew but it was great to read.

⌚ 1hr

### R1D4

I started with the book [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net) and it's amazing. Beside that I tried to start the Challenge from Wes Bos, [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com). After some minutes I realized that I'm not that far and should go back to the basics. So I read some more pages in the book.
After that I watched the first five videos of a German Javascript tutorial playlist from [The Morpheus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNmsVeXQZj7qOfMI2ZNk-LXUAiXKrwDIi)

⌚ 2hrs

### R1D5

Learned more about objects and arrays. Also some more details about arrow functions. 

⌚ 1hr

### R1D10

⌚ 2hrs

### R1D11
Finished Object Oriented and Functional Programming on FreeCodeCamp. Learned new things about arrays. It's amazing to see what you can do.
The next big step is Basic Algorithm Scripting!

⌚ 2hrs

### R1D12
Wow, I‘m not sure how I did that but I finished the first 8 challenges in Basic Algorithm scripting today. That’s amazing! The next one is „Truncate a string“, hopefully I can solve it!

⌚ 1.5hrs

### R1D13
I‘m now at Caesars Cipher challenge. Extremly hard at the moment.

⌚ 1hr

### R1D14
Wow, the second week. Sadly I couldn’t finish the challenge today. Maybe I was too exhausted and couldn’t think perfectly. 

⌚ 1hr

### R1D15
Finished the challenge and tomorrow I will start with the random quote site.

⌚ 1hr

### R1D16
Nearly finished the random quote site. Only the tweet button isn't working, the window doesn't work. Will try to search my fault tomorrow. 

⌚ 2hrs

### R1D17
Finished the [random quote site](https://github.com/HalloCoding/quotegen).
I'm not really satisfied with the design but I will redo it when I have further knowledge. I'm so glad that it works.

⌚ 2hrs

### R1D18
Finished my second project, the [local weather app](https://github.com/HalloCoding/jqueryweather). Learned more things about jQuery here.

Beside that, I started and finished [JavaScript: Getting Started](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/javascript-getting-started) by [Mark Zamoyta] on Pluralsight. Good day!

⌚ 5hrs

### R1D19

Finished the basic construction of the wikipedia viewer. Beside that, I watched a Pluralsight course. 

⌚ 1hr

### R1D20

Today I started on creating my first telegram bot. Spend around 3 hrs reading the Telegraf docs. Will upload the result in some days/weeks.

⌚ 3hrs

### R1D21

Learned a lot about Telegraf. Beside that I added the jQuery function for the random wikipedia page - was extremly easy, it works. Next task at this project would be to handle the search input ... after that I have to display it! 

⌚ 3hrs

### R1D22

Had a stressful day today so I just watched some more episodes in the Pluralsight Javascript course.

⌚ 1hr

### R1D23

Made some progress with the wikipedia viewer. The submit button is working now, I can get the value of the text field. I couldn't get the get request working for listening every result. Hopefully tomorrow.

⌚ 1.5hrs

### R1D24

Only 30 minutes left in the pluralsight js beginner course. It's very helpful. Beside that I worked on the wiki viewer - finally the ajax request works and I only have to show the results on the page. Think it's easy to realize with a loop.

⌚ 2hrs

### R1D25

Finished the pluralsight JS beginner part. Beside that I invested some time in the viewer. The loop is working, now I only have to show the results on the page instead of in the console.

⌚ 2hrs

### R1D26

Finished the wikipedia viewer - finally everything is working. I'm not satisfied with the look of the results... but I'm not sure at the moment how to improve these boxes. Maybe in the future!

⌚ 2.5hrs

### R1D27
