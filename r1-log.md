The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [30.03.2018]. 


## Log

### R1D1 
Today I started with jQuery and Javascript on FreeCodeCamp. I already know the basics, because I made a Node.JS course. But it was still a good exercise. I finished arount 88 items. 

⌚ 4hrs

### R1D2
I made some progress on FreeCodeCamp and finished around 33 items. Beside that I invested some time in searching some books. I will mention them in the following days.

### R1D3

At the moment I'm not at home so I finsished [JSforCats](http://jsforcats.com) today. The site included the most basics I already knew but it was great to read.

⌚ 1hr

### R1D4

I started with the book [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net) and it's amazing. Beside that I tried to start the Challenge from Wes Bos, [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com). After some minutes I realized that I'm not that far and should go back to the basics. So I read some more pages in the book.
After that I watched the first five videos of a German Javascript tutorial playlist from [The Morpheus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNmsVeXQZj7qOfMI2ZNk-LXUAiXKrwDIi)
