At the moment I'm not at home so I finsished [JSforCats](http://jsforcats.com) today. The site included the most basics I already knew but it was great to read.

### R1D4

I started with the book [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net) and it's amazing. Beside that I tried to start the Challenge from Wes Bos, [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com). After some minutes I realized that I'm not that far and should go back to the basics. So I read some more pages in the book.
After that I watched the first five videos of a German Javascript tutorial playlist from [The Morpheus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNmsVeXQZj7qOfMI2ZNk-LXUAiXKrwDIi)
